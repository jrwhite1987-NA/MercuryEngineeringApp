running, use the 'Apply Defaults' button then modify parameters as 
desired.

0x004 - Tx Pulse Control
  Read:  Holds the number of samples read per PRF
  Write: b11-0  = Tx DAC value (0x000 - 0xFFF)
         b23-12 = Tx cycles between pulse bursts (0x000 - 0xFFF)
         b31-24 = Tx cycles per pulse burst (0x00 - 0xFF)
  Examples (assume 8MHz sample rate):
    10% DAC, 8KHz PRF, 16 cycle burst = 0x100FA199
    20% DAC, 15.625KHz PRF, 12 cycle burst = 0x0C080333
    50% DAC, 6.25KHz PRF, 20 cycle burst = 0x141407FF

0x008 - Tx Frequency Control
  Write a value of 0x1 to enable transmit output

0x010 - Rx Gain Control
  Write Rx DAC value directly (0x000 - 0xFFF)

0x020 - ADC Frequency Control
  Write the divisor of 48MHz for the sample clock.
  Examples:
    16MHz sampling, 4MHz carrier = 0x03
    8MHz sampling, 2MHz carrier = 0x06
    4MHz sampling, 1MHz carrier = 0x0C

0x080 - Intermodule Control
  Read to determine if master (1 = master)
  Write a priority for intermodule arbitration.
  Examples:
    0x0000          = Self master.  Runs independently.
    0x0001 - 0xFFFE = Arbitration priority
    0xFFFF          = Slave only.  Requires another master.
